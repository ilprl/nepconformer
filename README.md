# NepConformer: A Conformer-based Nepali Automatic Speech Recognition System

## Project Overview
NepConformer is an End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system designed for the Nepali language, leveraging the Conformer architecture to address challenges posed by the language's diverse dialects, complex syllable structures, and low-resource nature. Implemented using NVIDIAâ€™s NeMo framework, NepConformer achieves a state-of-the-art Character Error Rate (CER) of 6.01% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 23.96% on the SLR54 Nepali speech dataset.

## Motivation
Despite the advancements in ASR for high-resource languages like English, Nepali ASR systems have lagged due to limited resources and datasets. This project aims to bridge this gap by utilizing the Conformer architecture, which effectively captures both local and global dependencies in speech sequences. By achieving a significantly lower CER, NepConformer sets a new benchmark for Nepali ASR systems.
